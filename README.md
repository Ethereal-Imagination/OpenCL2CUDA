# OpenCL2CUDA
This is just a attempt to create a helper to convert .cl
apliccations to CUDA applications. At first, it will perform
a bunch of changes in code, searching for OpenCL words and 
writing its equivalent on .cu files.

The files I'm using for testing are in this repository:

You can find more examples there, if you want.
